Headline: NEW: 'I think it is a fair agreement,' UI provost says of deal with GEO
Date: 03/08/18
Author: Julie Wurth
Article Text:  Updated 2:45 p.m. URBANA — Striking graduate assistants rallied outside Foellinger Auditorium on Thursday to celebrate news of a tentative contract agreement with the University of Illinois. The deal was announced late Thursday morning after a marathon overnight bargaining session. “We got our two biggest priorities related to addressing financial stability and guaranteed tuition waivers” for teaching assistants and graduate assistants, said Gus Wood, co-president of the Graduate Employees Organization. “We are super excited about that.” No details were released. A two-day ratification vote for union members was scheduled for later Thursday and Friday afternoon. The two sides had been at odds over language on tuition wavers, wages and other issues. Union members are in the 11th day of a strike. “I think it is a fair agreement,” said Provost Andreas Cangellaris, who was up all night getting updates from UI negotiators at the Fire Services Institute. “I feel good about it.” “I have to give credit to both sides. They were fully engaged, very careful and diligent in their conversations. I think they need to be congratulated for staying the course,” he said. “I’m delighted we’re here, and I look forward to bringing this to a closure.” Wood said the language on tuition waivers changed significantly from the UI’s last proposal, but he declined to elaborate. “The university made significant movement that we as a bargaining team felt comfortable enough to take to our membership,” Wood said. The UI had been seeking more flexibility with tuition waivers as it develops more self-supporting programs where students pay partial or full tuition. The union wanted to keep language guaranteeing no changes in tuition waiver policy, fearing the UI would reduce the number given out. Cangellaris said only that negotiators addressed the tuition waiver issue in a “very constructive and thoughtful way.” Chanting “GEO!” about 100 union members and supporters cheered when strike captain Jennifer Jones announced the news of the agreement at Thursday’s rally. “I’m extremely relieved,” said anthropology graduate student Amanda Butler, standing on the Quad with her sleeping bag after a two-night occupation of the UI president’s office. “I want nothing more than to get back to my students and teaching and finish writing my dissertation.” GEO members had started picketing as usual at 8 a.m. Thursday, but the union suspended picketing once the deal was announced around 11 a.m. following a 26-hour bargaining session. Union members also ended their campout at the Henry building and at a conference room in the chancellor’s office at the Swanlund Administration Building. But union leaders said the strike is technically still on until after the vote. If the agreement is ratified, TAs will return to work Monday. If not, they’ll be back on the picket lines, Jones said. Negotiators for the university and the union started the latest bargaining session at 9 a.m. Wednesday. The two sides had been negotiating for about a year. Graduate teaching assistants, who cover a large share of UI classes, walked off the job Feb. 26. The strike has forced the cancellation of several hundred classes and prompted instructors to move hundreds of others to buildings away from the UI’s main Quad so students and faculty didn’t have to cross picket lines. Professors took over some classes usually taught by TAs, and in some cases converting them to online lectures. Some undergraduates coming out of class at Foellinger Auditorium on Thursday shouted “GEO!” when they saw the rally. Others said they were happy to hear the strike might be ending. Senior Philip Knight, a senior in mechanical engineering, said the strike hadn’t really disrupted his classes, other than discussion sections with teaching assistants. And one of his TAs who was helping him with a design project went on strike. “We’ve had to rely more on our professor, but he’s super busy,” he said. “I’m happy they’re back to work.” Music Professor Adam Kruse, who performed at Thursday’s rally, thanked the union for its efforts. “This was nothing short of a fight for the soul of our university,” he said, adding “it’s not done yet.” Physics research assistant Will Morong was encouraged by the tentative settlement but wanted to hear more details. “Certainly the strike has gone on much longer than many of us expected,” he said. “It felt at times like a battle of attrition a little bit. We’re all very happy to see that it might be coming to a close.” Cangellaris said he had hoped the strike wouldn’t last as long as it did, but added, “we are in a better place today than we were 10 days ago.” He said the tentative agreement required “a significant commitment to find a common ground, and what I saw in the last 26 hours is that commitment at its best.” Wood praised the solidarity of graduate employees during the strike. “We were not going to go back to work, we were not going to suspend the picketing or the occupation, we weren’t going to give into anything that did not address our significant needs,” he said. Update 11:15 a.m. URBANA - The University of Illinois has reached a tentative contract agreement with its striking graduate assistants. Graduate Employees Organization Co-President Gus Wood said a ratification vote is scheduled for union members Thursday and Friday. The terms of the agreement were not released. The two sides had been at odds over language on tuition wavers, wages and other issues, and union members went on strike Feb. 26. "The bargaining team has signed a tentative agreement with the Administration, which will now go to the membership for ratification. Pickets for today have been suspended. If the members vote to ratify, our strike is over and we have a new contract. If not, our strike continues," the GEO said in a Facebook post. Campus spokeswoman Robin Kaler said the tentative agreement is "fair to everyone." “We’re delighted that the two sides were able to come together and work collaboratively throughout the night and into the next morning to hammer out the details that address the concerns that each group had," she said. Update 10 a.m. URBANA - With a marathon bargaining session entering its second day, striking graduate assistants at the University of Illinois returned to the picket lines on the Quad Thursday morning. Ashli Anda, spokeswoman for the Graduate Employees Organization, said picketing began about 8 a.m., as usual, even as negotiators continued to meet past the 24-hour mark in bargaining that began at 9 a.m. Wednesday. "They were up all night," Anda said. "We hope that it's safe to speculate that such a lengthy session means that something is done." UI spokeswoman Robin Kaler said Provost Andreas Cangellaris, who was out of town at a conference earlier this week, is back on campus and has been leading the UI's negotiating efforts the entire time, in close consultation with Chancellor Robert Jones. "We are delighted the union has joined us at the table for a long and collaborative session," Kaler said. Update 7:15 a.m. URBANA - Contract talks between the University of Illinois and its striking graduate assistants were still under way this morning after an all-night bargaining session. "It's been a productive night," UI spokeswoman Robin Kaler said shortly after 7 a.m. Negotiators for the UI and the Graduate Employees Organization started meeting at 9 a.m. Wednesday with a federal mediator in an effort to bring a 10-day strike to an end. Earlier story 9:34 p.m. Wednesday URBANA — As striking graduate assistants camped out in two university executive offices, negotiators reported progress in contract talks that consumed most of the day Wednesday. Graduate Employees' Organization Co-President Gus Wood said Wednesday evening he was hopeful after the union presented a comprehensive counterproposal to the university. "We are getting close, but there are some fundamental issues we are working on," he said. He didn't elaborate, but said the proposal covers wages, tuition waivers and other issues. Campus spokeswoman Robin Kaler also said, "We're hopeful." Working with a federal mediator, negotiators began Wednesday's session at 9 a.m. and were still going strong at 9:30 p.m., considered a hopeful sign. Wood said the talks could go late into the night. Graduate teaching assistants, who cover a large share of UI classes, walked off the job Feb. 26 in a dispute over proposed changes to the UI's policy on tuition waivers, among other issues. Graduate students who get at least a quarter-time teaching assistantship receive free tuition. The strike has forced the cancellation of several hundred classes and prompted instructors to move hundreds of others to buildings away from the UI's main Quad so students and faculty don't have to cross picket lines. The largest share have been moved out of Altgeld Hall and the English Building, UI officials said. Professors are taking over some classes usually taught by TAs, in some cases converting them to online lectures. The union upped the ante a bit this week, asking its members not to report midterm grades, which were due Tuesday, said GEO spokeswoman Ashli Anda. Anda said the grades will eventually be submitted once the strike ends; it will be part of the negotiations over how to handle teaching time lost, she said. She acknowledged that would affect undergraduates but characterized it as a minor "hiccup." "As soon as we can settle a contract, all of us who are TAs will get back to work and pump those grades out as soon as possible," she said. Most students can check their grades at any time through online grade-reporting systems such as Moodle or Compass, said UI Registrar Meghan Hazen. "Students are generally able to predict where they're at by looking at the grade book for the class," she said. Instructors are asked to submit midterm grades for every first-year student, but not all of them meet that deadline, she said. That's especially true in the spring semester, when first-year students are taking more advanced courses and may not need as much formal feedback, Hazen said. Typically, just over half of instructors submit midterm grades on time, she said. By Tuesday, 52 percent had been submitted — 18,730 out of 36,990 possible grades, she said. A year ago, the figure was 55 percent. Anda said some faculty members simply postponed midterm exams because of the strike. "Faculty are being really supportive," Anda said. The union has created a fund to help teaching assistants who will likely lose pay because of the strike, as they aren't being paid if they're not teaching. How much they'll be docked won't be determined until the strike is over, however, so they will receive their usual monthly paycheck on March 16 unless the strike ends quickly, Anda said. The strike fund had already topped $40,000 as of Wednesday evening, toward a $50,000 goal. Meanwhile, some GEO members occupied a conference room in the chancellor's office at the Swanlund Administration Building on Wednesday afternoon. Chancellor Robert Jones was not there at the time, Kaler said. About a dozen union members and their supporters were still occupying the Hall of Presidents outside UI President Tim Killeen's office on the third floor of the Henry Administration Building, which they had taken over Tuesday afternoon. Aaron Ammons, representing the Service Employees International Union, stopped by to offer support. It was part of a broader effort, on social media and elsewhere, to garner public support for the union from across the country. On Tuesday, about 30 members of the Chicago Teachers Union and the graduate employees union at UI Chicago marched to the offices of several UI trustees in the Chicago loop — Ramon Cepeda, James Montgomery and Patrick Fitzgerald. Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa spoke at Wednesday’s midday rally, saying the UI had undervalued graduate students. Democratic guberernatorial candidate J.B. Pritzker and Illinois Treasurer Mike Frerichs also stopped by to join the picket lines. Also speaking at rallies this week included American Federation of Teachers' President Randi Weingarte and #TimesUp activist Ai-jen Poo. And a Twitter photo of UI Provost Andreas Cangellaris and three of his counterparts from other universities at an online education conference in Arizona on Tuesday was seized on by union supporters, who criticized the provost for being out of town during the strike. One Twitter user superimposed this message over the photo of the four provosts, who appeared to be laughing: "And then the graduate students said, can we have a living wage?" According to a GEO photo online, someone also projected the words "occupied" and "fair contract now" on the outside of the Henry Administration Building on Tuesday night, similar to the technique used by activists on the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. "We're really hopeful that we can settle this before spring break," Andi said. News-Gazette.com embraces discussion of both community and world issues.

Headline: Probe into theft of '$13,000 or $14,000' of booze continues in Danville
Date: 03/08/18
Author: Noelle McGee
Article Text:  DANVILLE — Police are still investigating a burglary in which more than $10,000 in alcohol and cigarettes was taken from a local liquor store two-and-a-half weeks ago. The burglary occurred around 2 a.m. Feb. 19 at The Spirit Shop, 614 E. Voorhees St. Danville Public Safety Director Larry Thomason said at least two people “punched a hole in the wall” and stole the merchandise from a storage room. He said video surveillance from the business captured them leaving the area in a minivan. Owner Jesse Singh said this is the fourth time the store has been burglarized since he took over less than a year ago. During one of the incidents, burglars broke the front plate-glass windows. Another time, someone broke the drive-up window, “but he couldn’t get through.” Singh said he beefed up security by putting bars over the windows and door. This last time, he said, burglars actually made off with “a little over $13,000 or $14,000” worth of merchandise, mainly boxes of alcohol. He said the only damage was to the wall. Since then, Singh said he has taken addition security measures. “I added motion sensors that will detect any type of movement, noise, even vibrations all around the store,” he said. “If anybody or anything gets close to the wall, within 5 feet — it doesn’t matter if it’s a deer, a dog or human — it will send a signal to my phone. I can either call the police or take action.” Singh added that he and all of his employees are taking turns sleeping in the shop overnight. “There are four or five us, and we’re armed,” he said. Thomason asked anyone with any information on the burglary to call Vermilion County Crime Stoppers at 217-446-8477. News-Gazette.com embraces discussion of both community and world issues.

Headline: UI hockey feasibility study recommends downtown facility
Date: 03/08/18
Author: Matt Daniels
Article Text:  Division I hockey currently has 60 men's teams and 35 women's teams. Illinois isn't among those schools, but a new feasibility study released on Thursday indicates growing enthusiasm for the sport's potential addition to Illinois. But the Illinois athletic department isn't prepared yet to add hockey as a varsity sport at Illinois. "This will only happen if the DIA can successfully fund the program and receive needed support from various campus and community stakeholders," the department said in a release. The feasibility study, conducted by Collegiate Consulting and commissioned by the NHL, the National Hockey League Players Association and College Hockey, Inc., provides a possible timeline for when the program could start at Illinois. A transition to Division I could start as early as the 2020-21 school year, with Illinois as an independent team before making the move to play its first Big Ten season in the 2021-22 school year. The Big Ten currently counts Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Penn State and Wisconsin among its hockey members. The study recommends the development of a new facility on the location proposed in downtown Champaign. The Illinois athletic department agrees with this recommendation "and will begin focusing its planning efforts on the downtown location." Local developer Hans Grotelueschen proposed the downtown facility last summer, with cost estimates between $90 to $150 million for the new facility. The facility, which would have seating capacity between 5,000 and 6,000, could provide new competition space for hockey, volleyball, gymnastics and wrestling. "The downtown location allows the University to partner with the City of Champaign," the department said, "with its easy accessibility to the many amenities and business establishments that downtown has to offer (and) should serve as a boon to the local economy." As part of Grotelueschen's proposal, a conference center with a hotel and apartment building would go along with the new events center.

Headline: Charged: Tilton woman who allegedly drove Jeep into home of ex-boyfriend
Date: 03/08/18
Author: Noelle McGee
Article Text:  DANVILLE — A 49-year-old Tilton woman is facing several charges in Vermilion County Circuit Court for allegedly driving a vehicle into the home of her 70-year-old ex-boyfriend and battering and robbing him earlier this week. State's Attorney Jacqueline Lacy said Barbara L. Kohrman was charged on Wednesday with one count each of robbery, a Class 1 felony; aggravated battery, a Class 3 felony; and criminal damage to property and reckless driving, both Class A felonies. At Kohrman's arraignment hearing, Associate Judge Karen Wall appointed the public defender's office to represent her. Kohrman pleaded not guilty to the charges. Wall set Korhman's bond at $60,000, meaning she would have to post $6,000 in order to be released. The judge also ordered her not to have any contact with the victim, John Rife, or enter his residence. In arguing for the bond amount, prosecutors said that on Monday, a Tilton officer responded to the area Fourth and G streets in that village for a report of a fight. As he approached a house at 101 E. Fourth St., the officer saw a bent door key on the ground. Rife, the resident, came to the door and reported that Kohrman drove a tan Jeep Cherokee onto his yard and into the side of his house. He said she then got out of the Jeep, tackled him, took his keys, then got back into the vehicle and drove off. Danville police arrested Kohrman at the gas station by Walmart on Wednesday. Tilton Police Chief Dave Cornett said the incident on Fourth Street occurred at 6:06 p.m. "We believe it was done intentionally," he said, adding Kohrman and Rife used to live with each other. Cornett said Rife suffered some "bumps and bruises." He also estimated the damage to the home was less than $5,000. "Most of the damage was done to the Jeep," the chief said, adding it's owned by the man Kohrman currently lives with, and he was sitting in the passenger seat when the incident occurred. "She damaged the front end of the passenger side. It was probably a good $1,500 to $2,000" in damages. Cornett said this was Kohrman's fourth arrest in about two weeks. On Feb. 26, she was charged with one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, a Class A misdemeanor, stemming from an arrest in Georgetown. Court records show that Rife posted a $150 bond so she could be released from jail. Kohrman was also charged with one count of criminal trespass, a Class B misdemeanor, for allegedly going into a Tilton bar, causing a disturbance and refusing to leave. Cornett said Tilton police also arrested Korhman and Rife for domestic battery. However, no criminal charges were filed in that incident.

Headline: Urbana seeking developers for vacant downtown block
Date: 03/08/18
Author: Ben Zigterman
Article Text:  URBANA — The city is hoping the third time’s the charm for a property it’s owned since 2011. Urbana issued a request for proposals Thursday for the block north of its City Building and across from the federal courthouse, previously occupied by Urbana True Tires. Mayor Diane Marlin said there’s already been interest in the site. “I’m optimistic based on the interest we’ve had” from potential developers, Marlin said. The city bought the tire shop’s property at 202 S. Vine St. in 2011 for $400,000, completing its purchase of the block, and continued to lease it until 2014. Altogether, the city spent about $950,000 to buy the properties on that block. After two previous plans fell through, Urbana is now hoping developers can turn that block into a residential mixed-use, multi-story residential or high-density townhouse development, though all proposals will be considered. “To keep our downtown vibrant, we want to have more residential density near our downtown,” said Brandon Boys, the city’s economic development manager. “We’re excited. There’s a lot of good things happening downtown. It’s a great place to live with a walkable, livable downtown.” Boys said Urbana doesn’t have a specific price in mind, and any sale would need to be approved by the city council. The block is within a tax increment financing district and an enterprise zone, so incentives would be available for potential developers, Boys said. Developers have until April 16 to submit proposals. This is the third time the city has tried to redevelop this 1.75-acre site, bounded by Elm Street on the north, Green Streets on the South, Urbana Avenue on the east and Vine Street on the west. In 2011, Urbana developed plans for a six-story, $84 million “Metro Centre” that never came to fruition. In 2016, Indianapolis-based TWG Development planned to build a four-story, $30 million complex with 190 apartments and commercial space on the first floor. “They opted not to move forward with that project,” said Boys, noting that TWG is still investing in Urbana with a multimillion-dollar renovation of Aspen Court.

Headline: NAACP, others not fans of Champaign charter-school proposal
Date: 03/08/18
Author: Lyndsay Jones
Article Text:  Submit a Letter to the Editor here CHAMPAIGN — Concerns about draining the Champaign school district's resources have some community members skeptical about a proposed charter school aimed at improving academic progress in low-income and low-achieving students within the district. Founding members of the proposed North Champaign Academy said they are concerned with data from the Illinois State Board of Education, which reported that 52 percent of black Unit 4 third-graders were performing below standards in the reading category in 2017. The charter school, they said, could help reduce that number within the district since it could specifically focus on the needs of low-income and low-achieving students. But if the Unit 4 school board decides to approve the proposal, it would mean that the district would have to cover the cost of each student's attendance at that school — what's called a per capita tuition credit. And since the NCA's proposed focus is "at-risk" students, the organizers' application states that "NCA is seeking 125 percent of the PCTC for school operations." So, if the school served 100 students, founders wrote in the proposed budget they submitted to the school board, it would mean an annual investment by the district of $1,484,725 — or $14,845 per student, per year. Champaign County NAACP President Minnie Pearson reiterated the national organization's current stance on charter schools in an interview with The News-Gazette, saying a 2016 resolution of a moratorium on that model of school remains in effect. "What I can say in my stance as a president of the NAACP is that I do not support charter schools at this time," said Pearson, a retired Unit 4 teacher. "The research shows they drain resources from the public schools. Many public schools continue to outperform charter schools." According to the NAACP's national office, the moratorium would last until at least these four standards were met: — "Charter schools are subject to the same transparency and accountability standards as public schools." — "Public funds are not diverted to charter schools at the expense of the public school system." — "Charter schools cease expelling students that the public schools have a duty to educate." — "Charter schools cease to perpetuate de facto segregation of the highest-performing children from those whose aspirations may be high but whose talents are not yet obvious." Nathaniel Banks, a member of North Champaign Academy's steering committee, said that while he respects the NAACP's position, it doesn't reflect the thought behind the local charter school. "There's an old argument that charter schools are just private schools that allow white families to have their own educational experience without being around black children," Banks said. "We're in a different era right now. There are lots of alternatives for families in the Champaign-Urbana area: There are private schools, there are parochial schools, but low-income students have no alternatives." Pearson said that while she is not against anyone starting the school, her position as NAACP president and former Unit 4 teacher cause her to strongly "endorse the public schools." "In Champaign County, the public schools have better and more numerous resources for our children," she said. "They provide more arts and art education, sports and theater and more honor and AP classes relative to the private schools. All of the classes that the public schools offer, the charter could not offer that. They wouldn't have the resources." Still, she said, the district has more work to do to try close achievement gaps between its students. Patricia Avery, who preceded Pearson as head of the local NAACP chapter, said she, too, is concerned with academic achievement gaps within the district. "I share in their concern in terms of where we are with our students," she said. "Where we are now, it's raising red flags for me." North Champaign Academy's founding members believe one reason their school would create greater student success is because it would foster intense parent involvement, something they said isn't always common within the district. But similarly, Avery said she's part of an initiative to create an engaging program for parents within Unit 4 that will officially debut at three schools later this month. "We're hoping to have a kickoff where I think parents are the key component," said Avery, executive director of the CU Area Project. "The critical component is family engagement. We're looking at what the parents and what the district wanted. At our kickoff, we're hoping to get more information on what barriers they see and what services they would want to see." The program would be a sort of "parent university," aimed at assisting moms and dads and figuring out what resources they would like to see or need from the district. Avery added that it would be a way to foster more student engagement, by making parents more familiar with the district and offering workshops for them. Perhaps a district-wide offering in the future, Avery said the project, nearly two years in the making, will start at Garden Hills, Stratton and Booker T. Washington elementary schools. "We want to start small," she said. "It will be open to the (whole) district at some point, but we have to manage it from the beginning, so we're going to target those schools first. I think it will be a major step forward for the district." Regardless of method, however, Avery emphasized that something must be done to help all African-American students reach their academic potential within the district. "We've got to be willing to think outside and inside the box about what we can do to make sure we're not failing our kids," she said. "Its our responsibility to educate our kids. Education of our students should never be a compromise." News-Gazette.com embraces discussion of both community and world issues.

In light of the academic performance of African American students, something must be done, and it's worth a try to experiment with a Charter School. The biggest hurdle is hiring staff and creating lesson plans by August.  I don't think that's the biggest problem. When they suggest having it at the church and half the members are suing the pastor for fraud it's a problem. The bank is threatening foreclosure, that's a problem. The other location they gave? Can't find it. Not sure it exists. There are so many problems I don't think they can be solved by a year from August. Many of these kids have been exposed to trauma but there's no mention of it in their proposal. Just things like 15 minute math classes, same for English. More time is spent on recreation and socialization. It would make much more sense to work on the things in the schools to help all of the kids. Work with all of the parents to help all of the kids. Thinking inside and outside the box.  I think the school of choice was outside the box.  And the statistics back that this thinking has undoubtedly failed.  Inside the box, which was stated, was family involvement.  So creating a charter school will magically make the parents want to be more involved?  I don't understand this logic.   I agree with almost everything you say except that schools of choice "has undoubtedly failed".  The purpose of schools of choice (among other things, like putting gifted programs at certain schools) was to to eliminate the racially identifiable traits of neighborhood schools.  In other words, the goal was to get more white kids in schools on the north end and more black kids in schools on the south end.  That has happened. American children have been educated for 200 years in public schools. If the schools are failing to properly educate their students, it is the responsibility of the School Board to find a way to fix it. Throwing tax payer money into a charter school instead of properly funding and adapting public school curricula is not the answer. We do not need to reinvent the wheel.

Headline: Champaign almost done clearing Bristol Place for new development
Date: 03/08/18
Author: Natalie Wickman
Article Text:  CHAMPAIGN — The last pieces of the north-central Bristol Place neighborhood are being swept away for a low-income-housing development that is slated to break ground in May. Bound by Roper Street on the north, Bradley Avenue on the south, Chestnut Street on the east and Market Street on the west, Bristol Place was torn down by city government throughout 2017. The affordable-housing complex being built in its place is part of an effort to revitalize the area. Kerri Wiman, director of the city's neighborhood services department, said the neighborhood's last property was recently demolished. "There will be one more contract to remove the remaining trees and debris," Wiman said. "Some trees will remain, the healthy and viable ones, and new trees will be planted." A map of the affected area is shown below: Previously home to about 80 structures, Wiman said the new Bristol Place will have substantially more units. About 10 percent of them will be market rate, while the rest will be low-income housing, she said. Throughout this project, the city has worked to include small, local and minority- or female-owned contractors. The project's developer is the Chicago-based, minority-owned AHDVS LLC, and demolition work was split into groups of one to three properties so the desired contractors could bid on it. Community development specialist Jean Algee said the city chose five contractors to clear out Bristol Place: ICD Ironhorse Inc., Champaign Economic Restoration Endeavors Inc., Fenter Machinery, Miller Enterprise and Gallagher Excavating LLC. As the project progresses into construction, the city will take a step back and turn the site over to AHDVS. "We're grateful and excited that it's moving forward," Wiman said of the project. The city started preparing Bristol Place for redevelopment in 2014. The city council will vote on the project's master development agreement, financing plan and site plan on April 10 and May 1, Wiman said. A date in May for the groundbreaking ceremony has not yet been selected. News-Gazette.com embraces discussion of both community and world issues.

Headline: UPDATED: Missing Loda man found dead in Ford County ditch
Date: 03/08/18
Article Text:  CLARENCE — No foul play is suspected in the death of a Loda man who went missing from Penfield and was found three days later underneath his crashed pickup truck in a Ford County ditch. Ford County Sheriff’s Lt. Pat Duffy said 47-year-old Daniel Starkey was last seen with friends at a Penfield tavern around 9 p.m. Sunday and was reported missing on Monday. Around 2 p.m. Wednesday, a passer-by spotted Mr. Starkey’s 2004 F250 pickup truck in a drainage ditch near Clarence on Ford County Road 2600 East, near County Road 250 North.  Duffy said it appears the truck was northbound when it left the road to the west, striking and damaging a bridge guard rail. The truck then entered an approximately 20-foot-deep ditch, impacting the embankment. Mr. Starkey was ejected from the truck and was found under the truck in the drainage ditch, which had about 3 feet of water flowing in it, Duffy said. Mr. Starkey was pronounced dead at the scene at 4:22 p.m. Wednesday by Ford County Coroner Rick Flessner. Duffy said an investigation into the crash was not complete as of Thursday morning. Assisting at the crash site were Rankin firefighters, Paxton firefighters, Paxton Emergency Management Agency personnel and Reynolds Towing.

Headline: Mahomet man charged with molesting child
Date: 03/08/18
Author: Mary Schenk
Article Text:  URBANA — A Mahomet man has been criminally charged with sexually molesting a child in his care. Mahomet Police Chief Mike Metzler said Benjamin A. Crowley, 35, was arrested Wednesday. Metzler said his department was notified Tuesday by the Department of Children and Family Services of an anonymous hotline tip alleging that Crowley had molested a girl under 13 for whom he acted as a caretaker. On Wednesday, a professional trained in interviewing children about sex abuse allegations talked to the girl at the Children's Advocacy Center in Champaign. Metzler said disclosures made in that setting, including that Crowley allegedly threatened the girl if she told anyone what was happening to her, led police to interview Crowley. At the conclusion of the interview with him, Crowley was arrested. On Thursday, First Assistant State's Attorney Steve Ziegler filed a single count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against Crowley alleging sexual misconduct that occurred in February. Crowley's bond was set at $100,000. He is due back in court on April 24. The crime is a Class 2 felony carrying penalties ranging from probation to three to seven years upon conviction. Ziegler said Crowley has no prior convictions. Comments for this post are inactive. Start a subscription now to enjoy our award-winning local news and sports coverage.

Headline: UPDATE: Chicago man killed in Champaign shooting
Date: 03/07/18
Author: Mary Schenk
Article Text:  UPDATE, 8 p.m. Wednesday: CHAMPAIGN — Police are investigating the city’s first homicide of 2018, which took place around midday Wednesday in the northwest part of the city. Police were called at about 12:30 p.m. to the 1300 block of Sunset Drive, just north of Bloomington Road, where a Chicago man was found in the street, the apparent victim of a shooting. Champaign County Coroner Duane Northrup said Micheal White, 26, was taken to Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries at 1:01 p.m. Police began talking to neighbors but weren’t getting a lot of information. An evidence technician took photos and measurements and collected what he could from the west side of Sunset, where the man was found near a curb. There are no sidewalks in that area. The call about the victim was made anonymously to 911. Detectives ask that anyone with information call the police station at 217-351-4545, where an officer will speak privately with the caller. There were five homicides in Champaign in 2017, but arrests in only three of those cases. One man was convicted and is serving a 55-year prison sentence; a second is awaiting trial. In November and December of last year, there were nine shootings in Champaign that resulted in injuries, one of which killed an Urbana man.
