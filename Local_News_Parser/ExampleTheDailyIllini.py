Headline: ISG presidential debate highlights campus issues
Date: 03/06/18
Author: Madalyn Velisaris
Article Text: The Illinois Student Government presidential debate on Sunday highlighted issues including students’ representation and sexual assault, along with multiple crowd questions.The two presidential candidates that met for the debate in the Illini Union Pine Lounge are ISG senator and LAS junior Walter Lindwall, and ISG transportation representative and Engineering sophomore Jacob Rajlich.By the end of the event, Rajlich acknowledged that Lindwall is the more qualified candidate. “I must admit that Walter has looked into a lot more things than what I have and I give him a lot of credit for that because he has done a lot more work and preparation for this debate than I have,” Rajlich said. The Daily Illini Staff Writers Cori Lippert and Madalyn Foster moderated the event and gave candidates two minutes to express their views and eight minutes to respond to their opponent.Lindwall’s agenda included a 5-step plan of “academic and financial affordability, access to mental health resources, sexual assault prevention, expansion of diversity and inclusion on campus, and support for the graduate employee organization.”Rajlich said campus affordability is a big focus, and he is fighting to ensure that “students are paying the right amount for what they deserve.”The crowd asked seven questions on topics that ranged from the candidates’ relationship with Greek Life to the ongoing Graduate Employees Organization protest. Lindwall said he has been out there with them personally, picketing all week. “We have been out there on the front lines with GEO. We have been trying to be there in solidarity at their rally and support them,” Lindwall said.Lindwall responded and said, “I will have to agree with Mr. Rajlich to a certain extent. Three of the issues that you can really hang your (hat) on are outreach, preparedness and experience.”[email protected]

Headline: Baseball extends winning streak to five-games in weekend sweep
Date: 03/05/18
Author: Tatiania Perry
Article Text: Following last week’s two wins, the Illinois baseball team tacked on three more to extend five-game game winning streak as it swept the Dairy Queen Classic in Minneapolis.First up, Illinois took on No. 11 UCLA on Friday in a 5-3 victory at U.S. Bank Stadium. Tied 3-3 by the eighth inning, the UCLA relief pitchers struggled against the Illinois batters.“I was really pleased with how our guys went about things; they were excited. They want to play good people,” head coach Dan Hartleb said. “The name and the ranking didn’t matter.”The relievers threw 45 pitches to eight batters in the inning with 5.6 pitches per batter. The Illini walked three times and had two hits, the first from Doran Turchin and then Grant Van Scoy’s go-ahead single up the middle. All of Illinois’ runs came with the No. 8 and No. 9 spots in the order at the plate.But it was Van Scoy who launched the game-winning hit in the eighth with a two-run single.Prior the the eighth, UCLA was in the lead after scoring all of its points in the seventh. “The game of baseball is the game of failure,” first baseman Bren Spillane said. “You’re not going to be perfect every time, but it’s about how you bounce back.”Illinois saw its best pitching performance of the season from Quinn Snarskis, going most of six innings without a allowing a run. Ryan Thompson came in as relief going two innings without a hit, upon entering the game with bases loaded and one out. Closer Joey Gerber worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his second save, as Illinois didn’t allow a single hit on the final eight UCLA batters.The Illini came back to U.S. Bank Stadium on Saturday for a 4-3 victory over Arizona.Every Illini in the starting lineup reached base at least once, and the team totaled 11 hits and walked five times. Four of the walks came in the eighth inning where three Arizona relievers combined to throw 46 pitches—12 were fouled off by the Illini.Neither team took more than a single run lead throughout the duration of the game.The Wildcats briefly took a 3-2 lead in the sixth before Spillane doubled home Ben Troike in the seventh and drew the bases-loaded walk in the eighth.Michael Massey, Jack Yalowitz and Spillane had two hits each, and Spillane drove in two runs, while Mark Skonieczny and Massey had one RBI each. Arizona was limited to just six hits by starter Andy Fisher and relievers Ryan Thompson and Joey Gerber. Thompson secured the win by getting six outs in five batters over the seventh and eighth innings. In Sunday’s game, the last of the weekend, Illinois jumped ahead of Washington quickly for the eventual 7-1 victory.By the end of the first, the Illini had totaled four runs, with Zac Taylor hitting a double on the opening pitch. Following was an RBI-single from Massey and Jeff Korte’s two-RBI double.Illinois remained up throughout the duration of the game.Starting pitcher Ty Weber blanked Washington through the first seven innings.“We pitched extremely well. All three starters—Snarskis, Fisher and Weber—did a great job,” Hartleb said. “They got us deep in the game.”Weber allowed one run, scattered eight hits, struck out one and walked just one batter, throwing 59 strikes on 89 pitches.Throughout the five-game winning streak, Illinois has defeated the 2016 NCAA champion (Coastal Carolina), 2013 NCAA champion (UCLA) and 2012 NCAA champion (Arizona).“I think we are getting to the point now where people are going to need to shoot for us (because) we’re confident and were a good team, ” Hartleb said.@tati_perry14[email protected]

Headline: Martinez wins fourth Big Ten championship
Date: 03/05/18
Author: Jared Farmer
Article Text: Isaiah Martinez made history on Sunday. Wrestling Penn State’s Vincenzo Joseph in an NCAA Finals rematch, Martinez pulled through and secured his fourth Big Ten title — the first time anybody has done that in school history.But he doesn’t seem to think that much of the accomplishment.“It doesn’t mean a damn thing to me until I win a national championship,” Martinez told BTN. “That’s all I’m focusing on.”Martinez’ title caps off a weekend that saw four of the Illini Men’s Wrestling Team place in the top five of their respective weight classes: freshmen Dylan Duncan (133) placed third overall and Mike Carr (141) finished second and junior Emery Parker (184) finished fifth.To get to the finals, Martinez defeated Nebraska’s Isaiah White and Rutgers’ Richie Lewis. He controlled both matches throughout, defeating White with an early takedown in the third period and then got out to an early lead against Lewis that he couldn’t catch up to.Duncan began the tournament with a dominant victory against Iowa’s Paul Glynn, winning 9-1 by major decision to advance to the quarterfinals.Mike Carr followed that up with his championship match against Ohio State’s Joey Mckenna, a back-to-back Pac-12 Champion who transferred out of Stanford this season. To reach the finals, he beat Northwestern’s Alexander Mckenna in a victory by major decision, then in the quarterfinals went back and forth with Minnesota’s Tommy Thorn. Defeating Thorn 8-6, Carr then faced Nick Lee in the semifinals, and recovered after giving up an early takedown to win 10-6.In the finals, Carr struggled early on against the No. 1 ranked wrestler, who ended up scoring on five takedowns throughout the first two periods. Carr never managed to recover, as he was defeated 13-0 and finished second place. This title marks the third conference title that Mckenna has won, and his first Big Ten title.Isaiah Martinez chased Carr’s second place finish with his fourth title victory in an NCAA Finals rematch against Penn State’s Vincenzo Joseph.The match was a contested stalemate through the first two periods. Only Joseph scored, picking up a point from an escape. Martinez responded to start the third with another escape to tie the score at one each. The third period remained as contested as the first two periods, with both Martinez and Joseph failing to score on each other. With 10 seconds remaining, Martinez stole the victory with a last second takedown, winning 4-1 with a bonus point from riding time.“It’s been 351 days since we last wrestled,” Martinez said. “I was just trying to know myself and know my value. This was a return to form for me.”

Headline: Illini men’s basketball year in review
Date: 03/05/18
Author: Thomas Polcyn
Article Text: As the wise men of the Grateful Dead once said, “What a long, strange trip it’s been.” This Illini men’s basketball season was one of many highs and lows ranging from initial tournament hopes, a fifth straight Braggin’ Rights win, heartbreaking losses and many more big moments. But, it ended shortly, as the Illini were unable to extend their season into March and instead, are home getting ready for next season. Here are a few of the biggest things to take away from this Illini season. It’s important to remember that while there were some tournament hopes this season, this was still the first year of the Brad Underwood era, and was an extremely young and undersized team. That said, while the record certainly wasn’t the most favorable, the Illini still showed a few very important things for the next few seasons. Leron Black is the leader of this team, and had a phenomenal season. The versatile forward averaged just over 15 points and five boards per game this season, and was the biggest shotmaker in the absence of Illini legend Malcolm Hill. The two are very different players, but it was great to see Black step up and take over this team with a group that was not totally clear on who that guy would be. Black flourished in the role, propelling him to career highs across the board, and one of the most efficient seasons in all of the conference. Black is going to need to do the same next year, and if he can repeat his junior season again, the Illini will be in a great spot. Aside from Black, the Illini flashed plenty of other really nice pieces for the future. Trent Frazier was easily the most welcome addition of all of the freshmen, as he was named to the All-Big Ten freshman team and was even an honorable mention for the All-Big Ten teams as well. The guard averaged just about 13 points per game, and was easily one of the biggest focal points of the entire offense. When things ran through Frazier, it had a noticeably better flow, and led the offense to some of the biggest runs of the year. Nobody expected him to have the type of year he did, let alone to be the best freshman on the team. But, it was a welcome surprise, and he is a great player to build on going into the next season. Kipper Nichols was also a bit of a surprise. After a bit of a slow start, Nichols came out and averaged double figures on the year, including a career high 31 points in the final game of the season against Iowa. On a team that lacks size, Nichols is a really nice in between piece that can run the floor well as a small forward or even the center of the lineup when Underwood feels like playing small ball. His athleticism and ability to stretch the floor open up a ton of room for him and his teammates on offense, and he has the potential to be one of the best players on this team next season. It was great to see him take such a big leap, and I expect him to expand his game even further next season. While I could go on and on about all of the players in this team, I think that those three are going to be the biggest factors heading into the next season, along with the welcomed additions of the likes of Ayo Dosunmu and whatever other player sign up to join Underwood and Co. in Champaign. Adding them into the mix with guys like Mark Smith in year two, Aaron Jordan, Gregory Eboigbodin, Te’Jon Lucas, Michael Finke and more, and this has the potential to be a really solid team. Yes, there are problems, and yes, it’s possible that not everybody mentioned above will still be playing for the Illini next season, but as of now, there is a very nice foundation. By most standards, this was a disappointing season, and rightfully so. Bottom of the conference, losing record, no tournament, etc. While this is extremely fair, and is absolutely justified, I choose to have a different perspective. Sure, the “what-ifs” of the year could have made this a very different season, but the bottom line is that we were unable to finish. Illinois lost games like Iowa the first time, or Wake Forest or UNLV not because of just one or two mistakes at the end of the game, but because they did not play the full 40 minutes. I’m not saying this to give excuses, because there aren’t any. Play 40 minutes and win, and this is an entirely different season, and the Illini might still be playing. But they didn’t. It’s as simple as that. Instead, I’m saying this because even in a losing season, this team is not as far off as many may think. Obviously you want to see the tournament in year one, but for now, that wasn’t the case. What’s more important to me, is how they set themselves up for the next season, and how they will fare in year two of the Underwood era. By the end of the year, the Illini actually looked really good in most of their games. Sure, Iowa wasn’t pretty, and there was some bad stretches of basketball, but overall the team seemed to have a nice grasp of Underwood’s system. By round two against Michigan State and the game against Purdue, we started to see the offense that was talked about all offseason. Quick scores, alley-oops to lead off the possession, and overall good basketball. Unfortunately it took until February to get it down, but the point is that it is starting to make sense. An entire offseason in the program should do wonders for this team, and I would be shocked if we see the same kind of basketball that we saw in the beginning of this year played at the beginning of next season. Defensively, the Illini were actually pretty solid for the majority of the season. Sure there was the issues guarding big men, but that is to be expected with such a small team. In each and every game, opposing coaches talked about how hard it is to play against Underwood’s defensive sets, and that is a great sign for year one. As long as it took to grasp the offense, the defense was there and will only get better next year with more practice and hopefully more size. So, with that in mind, I do not think this year was an absolute disappointment, and instead, a good introduction. It can be hard to sit here and continue to say “oh what about next year,” but the truth remains that rebuilds take more than just one season. While this year wasn’t the prettiest, and who even knows about next year, the thing to keep in mind is that progress is being made. Underwood didn’t inherit rosters with a Keita Bates-Diop or Miles Bridges or any of those types of guys. That’s not to discredit Chris Holtmann and what he did with Ohio State this season, but the truth is that Illinois’ roster simply is not as good at basketball as the Buckeyes. But, he can get them, and as of now he has two very solid recruits coming in, with the hopes of adding even more.All in all, it looks to be heading in the right direction, and that in itself is a successful first year for me. As a lifelong Cubs fan, I know that expression all too well, and for this Illini team, it certainly applies. If you do believe that the foundation is there, and that guys like Dosunmu will make big impacts next year, there is no reason to believe that this will not be a good Illinois team next year. Will they compete for the Big Ten with teams like Michigan or Michigan State? Probably not, but they should absolutely be a very solid team next year. Dosunmu in himself adds a whole extra dimension and strengthens an already talented backcourt. Alan Griffin is another athletic wing that has the potential to get some early minutes. And who knows what other players will decide to join that duo. I, like most others, believe that there will be more size added to the team, and that alone makes this group much stronger. The rebuild will be by no means completed next year, but I do wholeheartedly believe this will be a solid team next year, and should be able to make a run at the NCAA Tournament. It’s early to say that, but barring any drastic changes there is no reason that Underwood shouldn’t be able to sneak his way in and win many of the games that the team lost this season. It’s been a crazy year in Illini Basketball, and there is still much to go with recruiting and getting ready for next season, but in the end, it was a first step in the right direction that the team should continue heading down over the next few seasons. The record didn’t show it, but in due time, it should. @TPolc

Headline: Advertising, marketing: the key differences, explained
Date: 03/07/18
Author: Sarah O'Beirne
Article Text: It’s often assumed marketing and advertising are the same despite being in different colleges. Though related, the two majors are distinct in their specialties. Professor Mark Wolters, instructor for BADM 320: Principles of Marketing, said marketing and advertising fields work together but are not the same job.“Advertising is a part of marketing because we work together,” Wolters said. “It is the creative and visual side of the business where people try to get the word out about a product. Marketing just entails a lot more — developing a product, creating a supply chain, pricing, service marketing — but I can see why people might get them confused because the advertising side is all they see.”Marketing is housed in the Gies College of Business, while advertising is in the College of Media.Though the College of Media is one the smallest colleges within the University, there are more advertising majors than marketing majors.According to the University’s Division of Management Information, for Spring 2018, there are 661 undergraduate advertising majors and only 250 undergraduate marketing majors.Wolters said the number of marketing majors has decreased over the years and the top-ranked accounting program in the Gies College of Business could be a reason for the smaller numbers.Marketing involves data analysis. Companies such as Facebook and Google can track online footprints and target advertisements based on data. Marketing majors can end up with jobs in sales, brand management, product development and consulting.“Marketing has had a lot of the job growth. With the all the collected data, we need people to understand what does it mean,” Wolters said. “If a consumer buys diapers, next coupon printed on the back (of the receipt) will be for baby food because we know the purchaser obviously has a baby.”Advertising, on the other hand, focuses on the creative aspect and directly targets consumers with advertisements. A major in advertising can lead to jobs such as creative director or marketing coordinator.Gianna Mazeka, sophomore in Media, is an advertising major. She chose advertising because it allows for creativity.“I came in (to the University) undecided and I took ADV 150 and fell in love with the class,” Mazeka said. “I think I want to work for a company and help them with advertising research and be hands-on with the products.”Isabel Angel, freshman in LAS, is considering changing her major to advertising.“Advertising interests me because it is technically business, but still allows people to be creative and use their own mind,” Angel said.Angel is taking ADV 150: Introduction to Advertising and MDIA 270: Introduction to Media Sales to help her prepare to apply for the advertising major in the fall.“I really enjoy my ADV 150 class because we get to dive into the concepts of advertising,” Angel said. “We looked at famous ad campaigns and discussed why they did or didn’t work, types of advertising firms and jobs within advertising.”Both majors, though in different colleges, are required to take BADM 320, STAT 100: Statistics, ECON 102: Microeconomic Principles and ECON 103: Macroeconomic Principles.BADM 320 focuses on concepts of marketing, such as advertising. The lecture of 550 students is a mix of many majors.“In a large lecture, I can’t tell exactly what students’ majors are,” Wolters said. “But I can see their reactions and when I talk about things, such as advertising and greater marketing communication, I see advertising majors perk up because it relates to them, but at the same time I get the same with reaction with service marketing and accounting majors.”Wolters said knowing the basis of marketing can be used for a variety of different majors, not just marketing.“Marketing goes into any business. You have to be able to sell yourself whether you’re an econ major or a journalism major,” Wolters said. “If I don’t prepare my students for the real world, then I have failed them. For a lot of these students, they only have one marketing course, so I want them to be ready to go out in the real world.”[email protected]

Headline: Assistant professor pioneers app to combat human trafficking
Date: 03/07/18
Author: Samantha Schrage
Article Text: Lisa Mercer, assistant professor in graphic design and founder of Operation Compass, is working to combat human trafficking with the creation of a new app. The app, called Operation Compass, was launched in December 2015 and allows users to anonymously report cases of human trafficking from anywhere in the U.S. Reports are immediately sent to service providers and law enforcement, who are able to locate the reported instance and take action against human traffickers.The app is part of a larger non-profit organization Mercer founded to create technology in helping fight human trafficking. Currently, there are two versions of the app available for download in the App Store and Google Play, including the national app, Operation Compass and Operation Compass North Texas. Mercer plans to launch a pilot program in Illinois this year to help fight human trafficking across the state. “Human trafficking is really hard to identify,” Mercer said. “Especially if there are people who don’t self-identify because they may not be reaching out for help. It’s really up to us to rely on our instincts and trust that feeling when something is not right.”While Operation Compass allows people to rely on their instinct and report any suspected instances of human trafficking, Mercer is planning on making some improvements to the app before it is launched in Illinois. “Something that we would like to add would be an educational program to educate people in the trade industries about human trafficking — what it looks like, how to identify it and how to report it,” Mercer said. While Mercer is striving to constantly improve the app, Operation Compass has already shown success.As of March, the app has had 20 suspected cases reported, 1,802 downloads and has been launched 3,877 times. Operation Compass North Texas has also been of assistance to Mosaic Family Services, who receive each report made on the app. “It gives people an immediate access point to be able to report something. Rather than having to go think about it or look for what to do, they can just take a quick look at the app and punch in information,” said Bill Bernstein, deputy director of Mosaic Family Services.Bernstein explained it’s a great tool for the community because it serves as a way to take immediate action when information is sent in.Mosaic Family Services works to serve survivors of human rights abuses, such as domestic violence and human trafficking. They provide an array of services to victims, including legal services, medical services, shelter, mental health services, as well as assigning a client advocate to oversee the case and coordinate services for the victim.Sulan Chang, assistant director of domestic violence and human trafficking services for Mosaic Family Services, said they are working on different ways to prevent human trafficking, including community outreach and education to help raise awareness.“Preventative measures in terms of outreach and education to populations that are potentially working in industries are more prone to having human trafficking exist,” Chang said. “We also focus on prevention education … about potential red flags, indicators or things to look out for, so they don’t find themselves in a situation in which they are being trafficked.”The app includes a wide range of features that allow human trafficking victims and their traffickers to be located, as well as any details about the situation imperative to the case. Through geotags, the app automatically populates the date, time and location. It also includes sections for descriptions of both the victim and the trafficker, so they are easily identifiable to law enforcement officials.There are also sections to include any case-specific details and contact information for the reporter. Mercer was inspired to create these specific features of the app through time spent talking with truck drivers, who are one of the largest population of people to report human trafficking instances. Mercer even attended trucking school to learn as much as she could about the trucking industry.Through this, Mercer was able to spend time learning what type of technology truck drivers used in their rigs to create a modified type of technology for them to report instances more effectively.“That’s really the whole premise of incorporating design thinking and research and design,” Mercer said. “It really allows the designer to know their user and to produce a product that’s really specific to their needs. You’re creating something with purpose and that can actually be used.”One of the things Mercer noticed about the trucking industry was truck drivers often neglected to report suspected cases of human trafficking, even if they had a gut feeling there were possible victims in the area. “I think there is this idea that if you’re not sure if it’s really something, should it be reported?” Mercer said. “There’s this question of what if I’m wrong (and) I think that stops many people from reporting it, even outside of the trucking industry.”Anonymous reporting allows truck drivers, or anyone for that matter, to submit information in a way that they’re comfortable with. It’s on their own terms, she explained.In the end, Mercer said it still contributes information to law enforcement and service providers, who will be able to then help the victim.Mercer said it is particularly prevalent to bring awareness to human trafficking because of how hard it is to identify. Many victims don’t even self-identify or reach out for help. Bernstein has noticed this when working with victims through Mosaic Family Services. “Human trafficking is about the most hidden crime imaginable. The traffickers are not going to want anyone to be aware of what they are doing and the people who are being trafficked do not self-identify or view themselves as victims,” Bernstein said. “They may feel that they got trapped into the situation by their own mistake or post-traumatic stress or fear for their family.” The best way to uncover this, Bernstein explained, is to have the most people aware of it.Mercer is especially proud of the way the app brings law enforcement and service providers together to work towards a common goal. She said this creates a great environment for victims and helps prevent future cases of human trafficking. Ultimately, Mercer hopes to create a foundation in Illinois and develop more connections with service providers that are willing to help vulnerable populations that could fall victim to human trafficking. She hopes that Operation Compass and other new technologies will create a future where more people are educated about human trafficking to prevent future instances. “My hope is that we will gain more accurate data when it comes to human trafficking,” Mercer said. “I think what this app allows us to do is create a collaboration between service providers on accepting suspected cases, and hopefully, through that, we can find ways to identify accurate data in human trafficking.”
